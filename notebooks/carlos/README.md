## TA Meeting (02/08/2022):
In the first meeting with the TA, we solved our initial doubts. They were the following:

  -How to design our PCB and can we use arduino? The answer was that we have to design our PCB wich will be very similar to the one in the CAD assigment
  
  -Which are our firsts steps?  The recommendation of our TA was starting by the more specific pieces of our project and after starting to escaleto back to the microprocessor.
  
  -What kind of microprocessor do we need? We need one that is compatible with all of our elements.
